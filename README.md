# Household Services Platform ðŸš€

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ This is a full-stack web app for booking household services, built by a 21-year-old who loves code, coffee, and making life easier. You can be a customer, a pro, or an adminâ€”everyone gets their own dashboard. It's got cool features, a modern UI, and is super easy to run locally. Read on!

---

## What Can You Do Here?
- Sign up as a customer or professional (pros upload docs, get admin approval)
- Book services, see your history, give feedback
- Admins can approve pros, manage users/services, and see analytics
- OTP password reset (email + Redis magic)
- Real-time slot holding so no double-booking
- All with JWT auth and a Vue + Vuetify frontend

---

## Tech Stack (aka, what makes this tick)
- **Backend:** Flask, Flask-RESTful, JWT, SQLAlchemy, Redis, Celery
- **Frontend:** Vue 3, Vuetify, Vue Router, Axios, Chart.js
- **DB:** SQLite (easy mode, swap if you want)
